# Arithmetic-Sequence-Generator
A simple Arithmetic Sequence Generator made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Make sure the HTML file and SVG icons are in the same directory, if not make sure to add the correct path to the CSS variable.

Change all the px units to em and add a viewport if you want this to render in correctly on mobile. 
I will update it later when I have time.
